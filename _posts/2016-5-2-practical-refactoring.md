Practical Refactoring
---

Check out [Llewellyn Falco and Woddy Zuill's excellent presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWiwDdx_rdo&ab_channel=LlewellynFalco) on how to go about refactoring legacy code. Loads of good advice. My notes below.


Simple techniques for code excellence.
---
>What is legacy code? Any code we want to keep, that works, we want to keep working.
Two Cars example. No rewrite. Different path. Happy and proud.
Code excellence is more about discipline that brilliance.

refactor in 2 mins  - never more than 2 mins to check in - run test every two mins

When to refactor?
---
refactor when you see code that is hard to understand.
Spend the time you would have taken understanding it to refactor it. Then the refactor is free.
Now you have code that expresses itsâ€™ purpose, you just have to read it.
The goal of refactoring is to make code more understandable.

Three C's
---

Remove clutter
---
- anything that doesn't add understanding or clarity
- bad formatting
- useless comments
- magic numbers

Remove complexity
---
Big methods "In every big method there are small classes waiting to get out"
- don't try to understand
- extract new methods, pull out scopes - curly braces
- undo extractions and fix incorrect scoping as it emerges
- Multiple return values problem - create a data object to return
- Rename as the code becomes clear - composing the method

Remove cleverness
---
If it is too clever to understand atleast encapsulate th e cleverness in a function (hide mess under rug)

Three D's
---
duplication, duplication, duplication
---
- fold all methods up
- take a look at the names
- group similar methods to find the classes within
- dry out code with polymorphism

Refactoring procedural code to Object Orientated code
---
Group methods by names
- group by arguments
- group by instance variables
- create class - move grouped methods  (look how code is now more robust) SR
- if classes have similar purposes, make the method signatures identical, extract interface / base class OC LS IS
- Invert dependencies -> remove new(). Pass in instead. DI
